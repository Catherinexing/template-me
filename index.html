          On a cold, grey morning earlier this year, Ermilio Sucasaire Sucasaire, a gold miner, sat in a white plastic chair, a stack of papers and a pen in his hand. His inquisitive eyes scanned a large room where a group of scientists were
          performing tests on his colleagues. One fellow miner rode a bicycle, panting heavily, electrodes attached to his chest. Another man had taken off his dirty sweater and was lying on a wooden bed, covered with blankets; a European researcher
          pressed an instrument against his neck while peering at a laptop.</p>
        <p>Sucasaire was next--after he had signed a consent form and filled out a long questionnaire about his health, life and work history, family, and drinking and coca-chewing habits. "I'm looking forward to it," he said.</p>
        <p> The scientists, led by physiologist and mountain enthusiast Samuel Vergès of the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in Grenoble, had set up a makeshift lab here in the highest human settlement in the world,
          a
          gold-mining boomtown at 5100 meters in southeastern Peru. An estimated 50,000 to 70,000 people live in La Rinconada, trying to make it--and, many hope, strike it rich—under brutal conditions. The city has no running water, no sewage system,
          and no garbage removal. It is heavily contaminated with mercury, used to extract the gold. Work in the largely unregulated mines is backbreaking and dangerous. Alcohol abuse, prostitution, and violence are common. Freezing temperatures and
          intense ultraviolet radiation add to the hardships.</p>
        <p> La Rinconada’s most defining feature, however, the one that had lured the scientists, is its thin air.
          Every breath you take here contains half as much oxygen as at sea level. The constant oxygen deprivation can
          cause a syndrome called chronic mountain sickness (CMS), whose defining feature is an excessive proliferation
          of red blood cells. Symptoms include dizziness, headaches, ringing ears, sleep problems, breathlessness,
          palpitations, fatigue, and cyanosis, which turns lips, gums, and hands purplish blue. In the long run, CMS can
          lead to heart failure and death. There's no cure except resettling at a lower altitude--although some of the
          damage may be permanent.</p>
        <p> CMS is an important health threat for the roughly 140 million people worldwide who live above 2500
          meters. In Bolivia’s capital of La Paz, which sits at 3600 meters, an estimated 6% to 8% of residents, or up to
          63,000 people, have CMS. In some cities in Peru, the rate is as high as 20%. But La Rinconada is the global
          capital of CMS; researchers estimate that at least one in four residents suffer from the disease.
          Like many chronic diseases, CMS gets short shrift from public health officials, says Francisco Villafuerte
          of Cayetano Heredia University in Lima. "In Peru, it's a neglected disease, despite the fact that almost one
          third of the population lives above 2500 meters," says Villafuerte, who studies CMS but was not involved in
          the La Rinconada study.</p>

          the La Rinconada study.
          A treatment could make a huge difference in La Rinconada and elsewhere, says Vergès. But to develop
          one, researchers need to understand what drives the runaway production of red blood cells, how it affects the
          body, and why it is a problem only in some people. They want to know what genes are involved, and how they
          have been shaped by recent human evolution. A deeper understanding of CMS might also help patients with
          cardiovascular disease, who also suffer from a lack of oxygen, says Giancarlo Parati, a professor in
          cardiovascular medicine at the Istituto Auxologico Italiano in Milan, Italy, who sent his doctoral student Elisa
          Perger to Peru to take part in the study.</p>

      <p>To answer those questions, the INSERM team trucked scientific equipment worth half a million euros
        up a muddy, potholed road this past February for a 12-day mission. The plan was to compare 35 men suffering
        from CMS, all highlanders, with 20 healthy residents, and also with healthy people living at lower elevations. It
        was an unprecedented effort, scientifically and logistically. Peru has a long history of CMS research--the
        disease was first described in 1925 by Carlos Monge, a Peruvian doctor. But most scientists work in Cerro de
        Pasco, a mining town in the Central Andes at a substantially lower altitude, 4300 meters. Nobody had ever
        done a study at this elevation.
        Sucasaire, who had heard about the study on local radio, was one of hundreds of residents who had
        come to the temporary laboratory – in a dilapidated concrete building made available by a mining cooperative
        -- hoping to be enrolled. If selected, he would undergo several days of tests that would examine a wide range
        of issues, including the composition of his blood and how it flowed; his lung, heart and brain function; and
        how his body functioned during exercise and sleep.
        Like others who showed up at the laboratory, however, Sucasaire was also hoping to get a medical
        checkup and perhaps treatment. La Rinconada has only one health clinic, which can’t keep up with the
        burgeoning population. "My knees," the 42-year old miner said. "They're painful and swollen. I can't walk
        down the slopes, I can't climb the stairs. I hope the doctors can help me."

      <p>Born in a village on Peru’s lofty altiplano, Sucasaire first traveled to La Rinconada in 1995, at age 17, in
        search of a job. Since then, he has left several times, once to try his luck at a coffee farm in Peru's northeast.
        Ultimately, he decided that La Rinconada was the least bad option, despite the harsh conditions. "This is a
        forgotten town," he said. "The government doesn't care about us at all. They only think about their own
        interests. We have to find a way to survive on our own."</p>
      <p>Sucasaire is a member of the Aymara, an indigenous group living in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Because his
        ancestors lived on the altiplano for many generations, he likely carries genetic traits that help him live at high
        altitudes. But evolution had not prepared Sucasaire for life in La Rinconada. In the initial testing, his scores on
        7 telltale symptoms, combined with lofty hemoglobin levels, indicated he had CMS, and he agreed to enroll in
        the study. For several days he had to return to the center for testing sessions that often lasted hours.</p>
      <p>In one experiment, Sucasaire breathed a minuscule amount of carbon monoxide, a toxic gas that binds
        to hemoglobin, to assay the total amount of hemoglobin in his blood. In another, he patiently lay on his right
        side while Stephane Doutreleau, a French cardiologist, performed an echocardiography to study his heart.</p>
      <p>One evening, he came in for a sleep study conducted by Perger. She taped electrodes to his chest to
        record his heart rate and fitted him with a movement tracker to monitor his breathing and detect any
        episodes of sleep apnea, which often happen during hypoxia. Wires led to a small recorder strapped to his
        wrist. On the tip of his left index finger, she clamped a small blue device that would monitor oxygen saturation
        in his blood. Then Perger sent him home. She acknowledged it wasn't the most comfortable way to spend the
        night, but Sucasaire said he would sleep "con los angelitos"--with the little angels.</p>
      <p>He lives a 10-minute walk from the lab, down muddy streets and trails. The one-room house he shares
        with three adult relatives is a windowless shack of corrugated metal that he bought 7 years ago, one of
        thousands of similar shacks strewn across the mountainside. A niece was cooking dinner on a portable gas
        burner. Although it was summer, beds were piled with blankets; the house has no heating, and snow fell the
        night before. "We just cover ourselves very well," Sucasaire said. For a bathroom the family uses a foulsmelling
        public facility nearby. They must buy their drinking water, and it is far too expensive, Sucasaire said.</p>
      <p>He works at a mine 20 minutes’ walk from town. Vast mountains of trash, packed in small plastic bags,
        line the trail to the entrance. Outsiders are not allowed in, he said.</p>
      <p>Many Peruvian mines are operated by large international companies, but gold mining in La Rinconada
        is "informal," a euphemism for illegal. Sucasaire works 5 or 6 hours a day; it's such backbreaking work that
        more is physically impossible, he said. He worries about the mine dust, the humidity, and carbon monoxide.<span class="quote">"Some of my colleagues have died at a young age--50, 48, 45," he said.</span> Fatalities caused by explosions and
        tunnel collapses are not uncommon; safety regulations don't appear to exist.</p>

      <p>Shut off a human's oxygen supply for just a few minutes and the result is irreversible brain damage,
        followed by death. But lower the oxygen level, and we are remarkably adept at coping, at least in the short
        term. Yes, lowlanders who ascend to altitudes of 2500 meters or higher often develop acute mountain
        sickness, including headaches and nausea. (Many Peruvian hotels have oxygen handy for miserable tourists.)
        But symptoms begin clearing within a day or two, as the body adapts by making lots of extra red blood cells,
        which ferry oxygen attached to hemoglobin to organs and tissues.</p>
      <p>Long-term living at high altitude is trickier. Many lowlanders have a hard time increasing their oxygen
        consumption enough for exercise and growth. Reproduction is especially difficult--a problem the Spanish
        discovered when they were colonizing the Andes. Hypoxia often leads to pre-eclampsia in pregnant women,
        which can endanger both the mother and baby, as well as premature birth and low infant weights.</p>
      <p>Populations that have occupied the high mountains for hundreds of generations do far better. Andeans
        have lived at high altitudes for 15,000 years or so, and like the inhabitants of the Tibetan plateau and the
        highlands of East Africa, they have evolved to cope with hypoxia, through complex physiological changes. Over
        the past decade, scientists have pinpointed several genes and candidate genes underlying these adaptations.
        They evolved independently in the three groups; in Andeans, a key adaptation is elevated hemoglobin, which
        enables their blood to carry more oxygen. In some people, however, the level rises out of control as red cells
        proliferate, leading to CMS.</p>
      <p>The excess of red blood cells makes the blood more viscous, straining the circulatory system. (In La
        Rinconada, some subjects' blood has an almost tar-like quality, making it nearly impossible to take samples.)
        Blood vessels, normally dynamic tubes that expand as needed, become permanently dilated. Pulmonary blood
        pressure often goes up. The heart becomes overworked.</p>
      <p>Other high-altitude groups have adapted to the low oxygen without significantly elevated
        hemoglobin—Tibetans, for example, primarily cope by breathing more often and taking deeper breaths—and
        do not suffer as much from CMS. A 1998 study found a CMS rate of only 1.2% for native Tibetans living at high
        altitude. The few studies done in Ethiopian highlanders did not find it at all. In contrast, one study in Cerro de
        Pasco found a prevalence of 15% for men between ages 30 and 39 and 33% for those between 50 and 59.</p>
      <p>There are no proven therapies. Phlebotomy, or bloodletting, is one remedy practiced in Peru; it does
        relieve the symptoms for a couple of months, Villafuerte says. But the procedure is cumbersome and further
        deprives the body of oxygen, which could have the counterproductive effect of spurring even faster
        production of red blood cells.</p>
      <p>A few drugs have been tried as well. One, acetazolamide, is also used for acute mountain sickness; it's
        believed to work by acidifying the blood, which stimulates ventilation. Two trials in Cerro de Pasco showed it
        lowers the hemoglobin content of the blood and increases oxygen saturation, but even the biggest study,
        published in 2008, enrolled only 34 people and lasted just 3 months. Whether its long-term benefits outweigh
        any side effects is unclear. "You would have to take it as long as you live at high altitude," says Villafuerte.</p>

      <p>La Rinconada is a bumpy 2.5-hour drive from Juliaca, a drab transit hub of a quarter million people at
        3825 meters. Minivans charge $5 for the ride, leaving from Juliaca's bus station as soon as people and luggage
        have filled every available space.</p>
      <p>Ivan Hancco, a Peruvian physician and a member of the research team, first made this trip in 2007,
        when he was a medical student in Puno, a nearby city and tourist destination on Lake Titicaca. More
        interested in research than clinical work, he was drawn to altitude sickness, but he didn't know much about La
        Rinconada. Few people in Peru do, he says. "I thought it was a small town. I had no idea."</p>
      <p>Just walking down La Rinconada’s busy main street, Hancco could tell CMS was a much bigger problem
        than in Puno, 1300 meters lower. "Red eyes, purple lips and hands, you saw them everywhere," he recalls. He
        began making frequent trips, first monthly and later bimonthly, to provide residents with medical advice and
        meticulously record their complaints. It resulted in what Vergès says is a unique long-term database on CMS?
        that includes more than 1500 people. (A paper on insights gained from the database has been submitted to a
        journal.</p>
      <p>Vergès, too, grew up at high altitude, in Font Romeu, a French ski town at 1800 meters in the Pyrenees.
        Its center for high-altitude training has made it a popular destination for European athletes. Vergès himself
        was on a national ski team for several years and studied sport science and physiology at the University of
        Grenoble. In 2003 he earned a PhD for work on respiratory dysfunction in endurance athletes, using his former
        teammates as subjects.</p>
      <p>Most of Vergès's studies take place at his lab in Grenoble, where he can simulate short stays at high
        altitude using a mask or a low-oxygen tent. But it's field work that makes his heart beat faster--literally. In
        2011, he hired a helicopter and took 11 healthy men on a 10-minute ride to a research station at 4350 meters
        on France’s Mont Blanc, where he measured blood flow to the brain and other parameters over 6 days. (Nine
        of the subjects got sick, as did Vergès.) In 2015, he was part of an expedition in Tibet that took 15 lowlanders
        to 5000 meters over 10 days to study the long-term effects of hypoxia.</p>
      <p>The La Rinconada study has its origins in a 2016 scientific meeting in Chamonix, a resort near Mont
        Blanc, to which Vergès had invited Hancco. They clicked, and Hancco decided to do a Masters in Grenoble and
        is now pursuing his PhD at Vergès's lab. Both researchers say Hancco’s connections in La Rinconada, and the
        trust he had built providing medical care, were key to getting the study off the ground. He helped recruit
        logistical support, including from Cesar Pampa, the president of a group of mine owners. (Pampa had lived in
        La Rinconada for years but moved down to Juliaca because his own CMS had become a serious health risk.) "It
        was a unique possibility,” says Vergès. “A dream come true.”</p>
      <p>Vergès did not have a grant for the study but found sponsors, including a mountain apparel company
        that outfitted the team with clothing emblazoned 'Expédition 5300.' (This was a slight exaggeration; one peak
        hovering over La Rinconada is 5300 meters, but the town and most of the mines are at 5100 meters.) The
        team produced a slick video, billing the study as "a unique adventure." And once they arrived in Peru in early
        February, the researchers kept their French audience updated through videos that showed the team panting
        in La Rinconada's steep streets and chatting with research subjects.</p>

      <p>Neither do paychecks. Most mine owners don't pay their workers a salary; instead one day every
        month the miners are allowed to take home all the ore they can carry in 50-kilogram sacks, and keep any gold
        it holds. (Some miners also pilfer extra ore.) The system, called cachorreo, turns life into a giant lottery. "Some
        people get a good amount of gold," said Sucasaire, "and some leave town." That was a minority. Most of the
        time, miners glean just enough to get by. But sometimes there is almost nothing.</p>
      <p>The miners take their ore to one of the many small shops in town that advertise “Compro oro” (“I buy
        gold”). To separate the gold, the shopkeepers mix in mercury, creating an alloy. Then they use a torch to
        vaporize the mercury, leaving small clumps of pure gold. The vapors seep through narrow metal chimneys,
        creating a toxic cloud that blankets the city and a nearby glacier that is its main water supply.</p>
      <p>Women aren't allowed in the mines, but hundreds eke out a living nearby. On a steep slope, Nancy
        Chayña sat shattering discarded rocks with a hammer. She checked each chunk for glittering specks, throwing
        those that sparkled into a yellow bag. Chayña said she had worked the rubble piles for 20 years or so, for at
        least 10 hours a day. Her heavy clothes were thick with dust and her face parched by the icy winds and intense
        sunlight. Asked if she'd prefer working in the mine itself, she chuckled and said yes. But women in the mines
        were said to bring bad luck, Sucasaire noted. And besides, the work was considered too dangerous for women.</p>
      <p>Peru’s government has plans to "formalize" illegal mining in La Rinconada and elsewhere, which could
        help improve working conditions. So far, however, little has happened. The mine owners oppose the idea, and
        the politicians have little to gain. Sucasaire didn't have much faith it would happen.</p>

      <p>La Rinconada was hard on the research team as well. There was the hypoxia, of course, which caused
        breathlessness, exhaustion, and concentration problems for some. Vergès slept badly, waking up gasping for
        air many times a night. A sickening stench hung over La Rinconada's streets --a mix of human waste and old
        frying oil—and decent food was hard to find. The researchers usually retreated to their hotel by 8 PM, when
        the streets empty, the bars fill, and La Rinconada becomes dangerous.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the town’s unmet needs troubled the scientists. Although Vergès and Hancco had
        explained the study’s goals to residents, the arrival of a group of mostly white doctors and scientists had
        raised unrealistic expectations. "They have new machines that can revitalize the body," one man sitting at the
        lab’s entrance said one morning. "Do you think the doctors can see me?" an older women asked, hopefully.</p>
      <p>The team did not have much to offer. Eight medical students from Puno did join the team to
        administer a health questionnaire to some 800 people, including women and some children. They measured
        their blood pressure and offered health advice--while also expanding Hancco's database. But they were not
        equipped to treat anybody.</p>
      <p>"It is an ethical issue that we have had to think about," Vergès said. "We don't just want to come in
        here, collect our data, and disappear." He worried that doing the study—and accepting help from a mine
        owner--could be seen as "justifying the exploitation of human beings… But does that mean you're not going to
        do anything? Or do you decide to do a study that may help these people?"</p>
      <p>Vergès hopes the insights they gain will eventually help lead to a treatment for CMS. In the meantime,
        he and Hancco hope to persuade more Peruvian medical students to visit La Rinconada and to get charities
        involved, such as Pharmacists Without Borders, which helps provide developing countries with drugs. Vergès
        said they are also hoping to persuade mine owners to take the medical issues more seriously, as other, more
        regulated mines in Peru do.</p>
      <div class="quote">"This study to me is the start of a long-term commitment," Vergès said.

      <p>This past June, five months after leaving La Rinconada, Vergès's team presented the some startling
        preliminary results at a high-altitude physiology meeting in Chamonix. Compared to 20 Peruvians living at sea
        level and another 20 from 3800 meters, the La Rinconada miners had colossal amounts of hemoglobin in their
        blood. Some carried more than 2 kilograms, the highest values ever reported, Vergès says. (Lowlanders, by
        comparison, on average had tk kilograms of the metalloprotein.) But contrary to what he had expected--and
        what most hypotheses about CMS would predict--hemoglobin mass wasn't significantly higher in men with
        CMS than in those without.</p>
      <p>One factor that did correlate with CMS, however, was blood viscosity: those with thicker blood were
        more likely to suffer from the syndrome. Taken together, those two findings have led Vergès to speculate that
        in some people the physical properties of their red cells lower their blood viscosity and their risk of CMS.
        Perhaps their size or flexibility makes the cells flow better, he said. It was grist for a follow-up study.</p>
      <p>The team also reported pulmonary blood pressure, which is around 15 mmHg in healthy people. In
        CMS sufferers it rose to some 30 mmHg during rest, and up to 50 mmHg during exercise. "Those are crazy
        values," Vergès says. "You can hardly believe how the capillaries in the lungs can tolerate such pressure."</p>
      <p>Sucasaire, meanwhile, looked back at his participation with mixed feelings. He had appreciated the
        attention but had hoped it would benefit his own health; but the thousands of physiological data points now
        being analyzed in France were of no help.<span class="quote"> "The doctors were very kind, but I still don’t have any results about
          whether I’m sick or anything,” Sucasire </span>wrote this month in a Whatsapp message to Science. His knees, which
        the team had not examined, were still hurting.</p>
