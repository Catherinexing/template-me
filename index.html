        <p>scientists are studying how life at extremely low oxygen levels ravages the body.


          By Martin Enserink, in La Rinconada, Peru

          On a cold, grey morning earlier this year, Ermilio Sucasaire Sucasaire, a gold miner, sat in a white plastic chair, a stack of papers and a pen in his hand. His inquisitive eyes scanned a large room where a group of scientists were
          performing tests on his colleagues. One fellow miner rode a bicycle, panting heavily, electrodes attached to his chest. Another man had taken off his dirty sweater and was lying on a wooden bed, covered with blankets; a European researcher
          pressed an instrument against his neck while peering at a laptop.
          Sucasaire was next--after he had signed a consent form and filled out a long questionnaire about his health, life and work history, family, and drinking and coca-chewing habits. "I'm looking forward to it," he said.
          The scientists, led by physiologist and mountain enthusiast Samuel Vergès of the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in Grenoble, had set up a makeshift lab here in the highest human settlement in the world, a
          gold-mining boomtown at 5100 meters in southeastern Peru. An estimated 50,000 to 70,000 people live in La Rinconada, trying to make it--and, many hope, strike it rich—under brutal conditions. The city has no running water, no sewage system,
          and no garbage removal. It is heavily contaminated with mercury, used to extract the gold. Work in the largely unregulated mines is backbreaking and dangerous. Alcohol abuse, prostitution, and violence are common. Freezing temperatures and
          intense ultraviolet radiation add to the hardships.</p>

      <p>CMS is an important health threat for the roughly 140 million people worldwide who live above 2500 meters. In Bolivia’s capital of La Paz, which sits at 3600 meters, an estimated 6% to 8% of residents, or up to 63,000 people, have CMS. In
        some cities in Peru, the rate is as high as 20%. But La Rinconada is the global capital of CMS; researchers estimate that at least one in four residents suffer from the disease.
        Like many chronic diseases, CMS gets short shrift from public health officials, says Francisco Villafuerte of Cayetano Heredia University in Lima. "In Peru, it's a neglected disease, despite the fact that almost one third of the population
        lives above 2500 meters," says Villafuerte, who studies CMS but was not involved in the La Rinconada study.
        A treatment could make a huge difference in La Rinconada and elsewhere, says Vergès. But to develop one, researchers need to understand what drives the runaway production of red blood cells, how it affects the body, and why it is a problem
        only in some people. They want to know what genes are involved, and how they have been shaped by recent human evolution. A deeper understanding of CMS might also help patients with cardiovascular disease, who also suffer from a lack of
        oxygen, says Giancarlo Parati, a professor in cardiovascular medicine at the Istituto Auxologico Italiano in Milan, Italy, who sent his doctoral student Elisa Perger to Peru to take part in the study.
        There are no proven therapies. Phlebotomy, or bloodletting, is one remedy practiced in Peru; it does relieve the symptoms for a couple of months, Villafuerte says. But the procedure is cumbersome and further deprives the body of oxygen, which could have the counterproductive effect of spurring even faster production of red blood cells.
A few drugs have been tried as well. One, acetazolamide, is also used for acute mountain sickness; it's believed to work by acidifying the blood, which stimulates ventilation. Two trials in Cerro de Pasco showed it lowers the hemoglobin content of the blood and increases oxygen saturation, but even the biggest study, published in 2008, enrolled only 34 people and lasted just 3 months. Whether its long-term benefits outweigh any side effects is unclear. "You would have to take it as long as you live at high altitude," says Villafuerte.

        <p>To answer those questions, the INSERM team trucked scientific equipment worth half a million euros up a muddy, potholed road this past February for a 12-day mission. The plan was to compare 35 men suffering from CMS, all highlanders, with 20
          healthy residents, and also with healthy people living at lower elevations. It was an unprecedented effort, scientifically and logistically. Peru has a long history of CMS research--the disease was first described in 1925 by Carlos Monge, a
          Peruvian doctor. But most scientists work in Cerro de Pasco, a mining town in the Central Andes at a substantially lower altitude, 4300 meters. Nobody had ever done a study at this elevation.
          Sucasaire, who had heard about the study on local radio, was one of hundreds of residents who had come to the temporary laboratory – in a dilapidated concrete building made available by a mining cooperative -- hoping to be enrolled. If
          selected, he would undergo several days of tests that would examine a wide range of issues, including the composition of his blood and how it flowed; his lung, heart and brain function; and how his body functioned during exercise and sleep.
          Like others who showed up at the laboratory, however, Sucasaire was also hoping to get a medical checkup and perhaps treatment. La Rinconada has only one health clinic, which can’t keep up with the burgeoning population. "My knees," the
          42-year old miner said. "They're painful and swollen. I can't walk down the slopes, I can't climb the stairs. I hope the doctors can help me."
          just a few minutes and the result is irreversible brain damage, followed by death. But lower the oxygen level, and we are remarkably adept at coping, at least in the short term. Yes, lowlanders who ascend to altitudes of 2500 meters or higher
          often develop acute mountain sickness, including headaches and nausea. (Many Peruvian hotels have oxygen handy for miserable tourists.) But symptoms begin clearing within a day or two, as the body adapts by making lots of extra red blood
          cells, which ferry oxygen attached to hemoglobin to organs and tissues.
          Long-term living at high altitude is trickier. Many lowlanders have a hard time increasing their oxygen consumption enough for exercise and growth. Reproduction is especially difficult--a problem the Spanish discovered when they were
          colonizing the Andes. Hypoxia often leads to pre-eclampsia in pregnant women, which can endanger both the mother and baby, as well as premature birth and low infant weights.
          Populations that have occupied the high mountains for hundreds of generations do far better. Andeans have lived at high altitudes for 15,000 years or so, and like the inhabitants of the Tibetan plateau and the highlands of East Africa, they
          have evolved to cope with hypoxia, through complex physiological changes. Over the past decade, scientists have pinpointed several genes and candidate genes underlying these adaptations. They evolved independently in the three groups; in
          Andeans, a key adaptation is elevated hemoglobin, which enables their blood to carry more oxygen. In some people, however, the level rises out of control as red cells proliferate, leading to CMS.
          The excess of red blood cells makes the blood more viscous, straining the circulatory system. (In La Rinconada, some subjects' blood has an almost tar-like quality, making it nearly impossible to take samples.) Blood vessels, normally dynamic
          tubes that expand as needed, become permanently dilated. Pulmonary blood pressure often goes up. The heart becomes overworked.
          Other high-altitude groups have adapted to the low oxygen without significantly elevated hemoglobin—Tibetans, for example, primarily cope by breathing more often and taking deeper breaths—and do not suffer as much from CMS. A 1998 study found
          a CMS rate of only 1.2% for native Tibetans living at high altitude. The few studies done in Ethiopian highlanders did not find it at all. In contrast, one study in Cerro de Pasco found a prevalence of 15% for men between ages 30 and 39 and
          33% for those between 50 and 59.
