        <p>

          On a cold, grey morning earlier this year, Ermilio Sucasaire Sucasaire, a gold miner, sat in a white plastic chair, a stack of papers and a pen in his hand. His inquisitive eyes scanned a large room where a group of scientists were
          performing tests on his colleagues. One fellow miner rode a bicycle, panting heavily, electrodes attached to his chest. Another man had taken off his dirty sweater and was lying on a wooden bed, covered with blankets; a European researcher
          pressed an instrument against his neck while peering at a laptop.</p>
          <p>Sucasaire was next--after he had signed a consent form and filled out a long questionnaire about his health, life and work history, family, and drinking and coca-chewing habits. "I'm looking forward to it," he said.</p>
          <p>  The scientists, led by physiologist and mountain enthusiast Samuel Vergès of the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in Grenoble, had set up a makeshift lab here in the highest human settlement in the world, a
            gold-mining boomtown at 5100 meters in southeastern Peru. An estimated 50,000 to 70,000 people live in La Rinconada, trying to make it--and, many hope, strike it rich—under brutal conditions. The city has no running water, no sewage system,
            and no garbage removal. It is heavily contaminated with mercury, used to extract the gold. Work in the largely unregulated mines is backbreaking and dangerous. Alcohol abuse, prostitution, and violence are common. Freezing temperatures and
            intense ultraviolet radiation add to the hardships.</p>
      <p>  La Rinconada’s most defining feature, however, the one that had lured the scientists, is its thin air.
        Every breath you take here contains half as much oxygen as at sea level. The constant oxygen deprivation can
        cause a syndrome called chronic mountain sickness (CMS), whose defining feature is an excessive proliferation
        of red blood cells. Symptoms include dizziness, headaches, ringing ears, sleep problems, breathlessness,
        palpitations, fatigue, and cyanosis, which turns lips, gums, and hands purplish blue. In the long run, CMS can
        lead to heart failure and death. There's no cure except resettling at a lower altitude--although some of the
        damage may be permanent.</p>
        <p>    CMS is an important health threat for the roughly 140 million people worldwide who live above 2500
            meters. In Bolivia’s capital of La Paz, which sits at 3600 meters, an estimated 6% to 8% of residents, or up to
            63,000 people, have CMS. In some cities in Peru, the rate is as high as 20%. But La Rinconada is the global
            capital of CMS; researchers estimate that at least one in four residents suffer from the disease.
            Like many chronic diseases, CMS gets short shrift from public health officials, says Francisco Villafuerte
            of Cayetano Heredia University in Lima. "In Peru, it's a neglected disease, despite the fact that almost one
            third of the population lives above 2500 meters," says Villafuerte, who studies CMS but was not involved in
            the La Rinconada study.</p>

              the La Rinconada study.
              A treatment could make a huge difference in La Rinconada and elsewhere, says Vergès. But to develop
              one, researchers need to understand what drives the runaway production of red blood cells, how it affects the
              body, and why it is a problem only in some people. They want to know what genes are involved, and how they
              have been shaped by recent human evolution. A deeper understanding of CMS might also help patients with
              cardiovascular disease, who also suffer from a lack of oxygen, says Giancarlo Parati, a professor in
              cardiovascular medicine at the Istituto Auxologico Italiano in Milan, Italy, who sent his doctoral student Elisa
              Perger to Peru to take part in the study.</p>

        <p>To answer those questions, the INSERM team trucked scientific equipment worth half a million euros
          up a muddy, potholed road this past February for a 12-day mission. The plan was to compare 35 men suffering
          from CMS, all highlanders, with 20 healthy residents, and also with healthy people living at lower elevations. It
          was an unprecedented effort, scientifically and logistically. Peru has a long history of CMS research--the
          disease was first described in 1925 by Carlos Monge, a Peruvian doctor. But most scientists work in Cerro de
          Pasco, a mining town in the Central Andes at a substantially lower altitude, 4300 meters. Nobody had ever
          done a study at this elevation.
          Sucasaire, who had heard about the study on local radio, was one of hundreds of residents who had
          come to the temporary laboratory – in a dilapidated concrete building made available by a mining cooperative
          -- hoping to be enrolled. If selected, he would undergo several days of tests that would examine a wide range
          of issues, including the composition of his blood and how it flowed; his lung, heart and brain function; and
          how his body functioned during exercise and sleep.
          Like others who showed up at the laboratory, however, Sucasaire was also hoping to get a medical
          checkup and perhaps treatment. La Rinconada has only one health clinic, which can’t keep up with the
          burgeoning population. "My knees," the 42-year old miner said. "They're painful and swollen. I can't walk
          down the slopes, I can't climb the stairs. I hope the doctors can help me."

      <p>Born in a village on Peru’s lofty altiplano, Sucasaire first traveled to La Rinconada in 1995, at age 17, in
        search of a job. Since then, he has left several times, once to try his luck at a coffee farm in Peru's northeast.
        Ultimately, he decided that La Rinconada was the least bad option, despite the harsh conditions. "This is a
        forgotten town," he said. "The government doesn't care about us at all. They only think about their own
        interests. We have to find a way to survive on our own."</p>
      <p>Sucasaire is a member of the Aymara, an indigenous group living in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Because his
        ancestors lived on the altiplano for many generations, he likely carries genetic traits that help him live at high
        altitudes. But evolution had not prepared Sucasaire for life in La Rinconada. In the initial testing, his scores on
        7 telltale symptoms, combined with lofty hemoglobin levels, indicated he had CMS, and he agreed to enroll in
        the study. For several days he had to return to the center for testing sessions that often lasted hours.</p>
      <p>In one experiment, Sucasaire breathed a minuscule amount of carbon monoxide, a toxic gas that binds
        to hemoglobin, to assay the total amount of hemoglobin in his blood. In another, he patiently lay on his right
        side while Stephane Doutreleau, a French cardiologist, performed an echocardiography to study his heart.</p>
      <p>One evening, he came in for a sleep study conducted by Perger. She taped electrodes to his chest to
        record his heart rate and fitted him with a movement tracker to monitor his breathing and detect any
        episodes of sleep apnea, which often happen during hypoxia. Wires led to a small recorder strapped to his
        wrist. On the tip of his left index finger, she clamped a small blue device that would monitor oxygen saturation
        in his blood. Then Perger sent him home. She acknowledged it wasn't the most comfortable way to spend the
        night, but Sucasaire said he would sleep "con los angelitos"--with the little angels.</p>
      <p>He lives a 10-minute walk from the lab, down muddy streets and trails. The one-room house he shares
        with three adult relatives is a windowless shack of corrugated metal that he bought 7 years ago, one of
        thousands of similar shacks strewn across the mountainside. A niece was cooking dinner on a portable gas
        burner. Although it was summer, beds were piled with blankets; the house has no heating, and snow fell the
        night before. "We just cover ourselves very well," Sucasaire said. For a bathroom the family uses a foulsmelling
        public facility nearby. They must buy their drinking water, and it is far too expensive, Sucasaire said.</p>
      <p>He works at a mine 20 minutes’ walk from town. Vast mountains of trash, packed in small plastic bags,
        line the trail to the entrance. Outsiders are not allowed in, he said.</p>
      <p>Many Peruvian mines are operated by large international companies, but gold mining in La Rinconada
        is "informal," a euphemism for illegal. Sucasaire works 5 or 6 hours a day; it's such backbreaking work that
        more is physically impossible, he said. He worries about the mine dust, the humidity, and carbon monoxide.<span class="quote">"Some of my colleagues have died at a young age--50, 48, 45," he said.</span> Fatalities caused by explosions and
        tunnel collapses are not uncommon; safety regulations don't appear to exist.</p>

      <p>Neither do paychecks. Most mine owners don't pay their workers a salary; instead one day every
        month the miners are allowed to take home all the ore they can carry in 50-kilogram sacks, and keep any gold
        it holds. (Some miners also pilfer extra ore.) The system, called cachorreo, turns life into a giant lottery. "Some
        people get a good amount of gold," said Sucasaire, "and some leave town." That was a minority. Most of the
        time, miners glean just enough to get by. But sometimes there is almost nothing.</p>
      <p>The miners take their ore to one of the many small shops in town that advertise “Compro oro” (“I buy
        gold”). To separate the gold, the shopkeepers mix in mercury, creating an alloy. Then they use a torch to
        vaporize the mercury, leaving small clumps of pure gold. The vapors seep through narrow metal chimneys,
        creating a toxic cloud that blankets the city and a nearby glacier that is its main water supply.</p>
      <p>Women aren't allowed in the mines, but hundreds eke out a living nearby. On a steep slope, Nancy
        Chayña sat shattering discarded rocks with a hammer. She checked each chunk for glittering specks, throwing
        those that sparkled into a yellow bag. Chayña said she had worked the rubble piles for 20 years or so, for at
        least 10 hours a day. Her heavy clothes were thick with dust and her face parched by the icy winds and intense
        sunlight. Asked if she'd prefer working in the mine itself, she chuckled and said yes. But women in the mines
        were said to bring bad luck, Sucasaire noted. And besides, the work was considered too dangerous for women.</p>
      <p>Peru’s government has plans to "formalize" illegal mining in La Rinconada and elsewhere, which could
        help improve working conditions. So far, however, little has happened. The mine owners oppose the idea, and
        the politicians have little to gain. Sucasaire didn't have much faith it would happen.</p>

      <p>La Rinconada was hard on the research team as well. There was the hypoxia, of course, which caused
        breathlessness, exhaustion, and concentration problems for some. Vergès slept badly, waking up gasping for
        air many times a night. A sickening stench hung over La Rinconada's streets --a mix of human waste and old
        frying oil—and decent food was hard to find. The researchers usually retreated to their hotel by 8 PM, when
        the streets empty, the bars fill, and La Rinconada becomes dangerous.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the town’s unmet needs troubled the scientists. Although Vergès and Hancco had
        explained the study’s goals to residents, the arrival of a group of mostly white doctors and scientists had
        raised unrealistic expectations. "They have new machines that can revitalize the body," one man sitting at the
        lab’s entrance said one morning. "Do you think the doctors can see me?" an older women asked, hopefully.</p>
      <p>The team did not have much to offer. Eight medical students from Puno did join the team to
        administer a health questionnaire to some 800 people, including women and some children. They measured
        their blood pressure and offered health advice--while also expanding Hancco's database. But they were not
        equipped to treat anybody.</p>
      <p>"It is an ethical issue that we have had to think about," Vergès said. "We don't just want to come in
        here, collect our data, and disappear." He worried that doing the study—and accepting help from a mine
        owner--could be seen as "justifying the exploitation of human beings… But does that mean you're not going to
        do anything? Or do you decide to do a study that may help these people?"</p>
      <p>Vergès hopes the insights they gain will eventually help lead to a treatment for CMS. In the meantime,
        he and Hancco hope to persuade more Peruvian medical students to visit La Rinconada and to get charities
        involved, such as Pharmacists Without Borders, which helps provide developing countries with drugs. Vergès
        said they are also hoping to persuade mine owners to take the medical issues more seriously, as other, more
        regulated mines in Peru do.</p>
      <div class="quote">"This study to me is the start of a long-term commitment," Vergès said.

<p>This past June, five months after leaving La Rinconada, Vergès's team presented the some startling
preliminary results at a high-altitude physiology meeting in Chamonix. Compared to 20 Peruvians living at sea
level and another 20 from 3800 meters, the La Rinconada miners had colossal amounts of hemoglobin in their
blood. Some carried more than 2 kilograms, the highest values ever reported, Vergès says. (Lowlanders, by
comparison, on average had tk kilograms of the metalloprotein.) But contrary to what he had expected--and
what most hypotheses about CMS would predict--hemoglobin mass wasn't significantly higher in men with
CMS than in those without.</p>
<p>One factor that did correlate with CMS, however, was blood viscosity: those with thicker blood were
more likely to suffer from the syndrome. Taken together, those two findings have led Vergès to speculate that
in some people the physical properties of their red cells lower their blood viscosity and their risk of CMS.
Perhaps their size or flexibility makes the cells flow better, he said. It was grist for a follow-up study.</p>
<p>The team also reported pulmonary blood pressure, which is around 15 mmHg in healthy people. In
CMS sufferers it rose to some 30 mmHg during rest, and up to 50 mmHg during exercise. "Those are crazy
values," Vergès says. "You can hardly believe how the capillaries in the lungs can tolerate such pressure."</p>
<p>Sucasaire, meanwhile, looked back at his participation with mixed feelings. He had appreciated the
attention but had hoped it would benefit his own health; but the thousands of physiological data points now
being analyzed in France were of no help.<span class = "quote"> "The doctors were very kind, but I still don’t have any results about
whether I’m sick or anything,” Sucasire </span>wrote this month in a Whatsapp message to Science. His knees, which
the team had not examined, were still hurting.</p>
